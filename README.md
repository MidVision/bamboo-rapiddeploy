# RapidDeploy plugin

This plugin allows you to use [RapidDeploy](http://www.midvision.com/product) from Jenkins. The plugin can be used with RapidDeploy 3.3.79+ (We recommend the newest 3.5.18 version).

There are two tasks that you can use in your jobs in Bamboo
* [RapidDeploy build package task](http://docs.midvision.com/LATEST/project/package.html) invoke RapidDeploy server to build a package in the configured artifact repository. You can check the result and the log output in the Job Result summary in your Bamboo instance.
* [RapidDeploy project deploy task](http://docs.midvision.com/LATEST/project/deployment.html) invoke a deployment task in RapidDeploy server. Multiple deployments can be executed sequentially or parallel. You can check the result and the process logs in the Job Result summary in your Bamboo instance.

### RapidDeploy build package task

Attributes:
* RapidDeploy server url: provide the server path to your RapidDeploy with the starting http included (e.g.:http://192.168.1.1:8090/MidVision).
* RapidDeploy authentication token: provide your authentication token, which can be generated by the encryptor tool. The tool is placed under the server home directory (MV_HOME for RapidDeploy) in tools: run-web-service-encrypter.
* RapidDeploy project: RapidDeploy project name, which you want to build a package for.
* Package name (optional): set a specific package name. If not filled, the next version will be assigned to the package automatically. This field doesnâ€™t have to be used in general.
* Archive extension: choose the package type from a list of extensions.


### RapidDeploy project deploy task
